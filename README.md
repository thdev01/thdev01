# I write things that (hopefully) make sense to machines.  
```Sometimes they even compile.```

### 🧠 What I Do
I spend most of my time exploring how code becomes meaning —  
from low-level logic to high-level abstractions.

- 🦀 **Rust** → systems programming and chasing performance dragons.  
- ⚗️ **Elixir** → concurrent backends that actually stay alive.  
- 🌀 **Go & TypeScript** → APIs, tools, and modern backend architecture.  
- ⚛️ **Next.js + React** → because someone has to make it look nice too.

### 🚀 What I'm Working On
- Building tools that help developers talk to machines more clearly.  
- Experimenting with distributed systems, AI agents, and compilers.  
- Turning caffeine into code (and occasionally, into bugs).

### 📫 How to Reach Me
If you like logic, language, or chaos disguised as code — let’s talk.  
I’m always building, learning, and occasionally refactoring my own mind.
